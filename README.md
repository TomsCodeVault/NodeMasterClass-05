# CLI for Pizza Delivery API #

This assignment builds a cli through which administrative tasks can be accomplished. To test, simply clone the repo, start the application and type man or help in the terminal to get a list of commands.

In order to get results from most of the commands you will need to create a user or users, and place some orders. The easiest way to do that is to use the gui application. Before you can create orders you will need to add Stripe and Mailgun credentials to the config.js file.
